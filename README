Requirements:
* Node.js installed
  You can set the command for Node.js in Makefile if you like, or like `make NODEJS=/path/to/nodejs`

Simply run `make`

Building the parser is done in two steps: PEG does not come with ready sources, the appropriate files have to be appended together and modified. We don't use the Rakefile because it depends on Ruby and other stuff to be installed. Plus it's simpler.

The finished peg.node.js can be used as a Node.js module, it's recommended you symlink that to 'peg.js' if you require it from a script.

Then the finished file for that is called with the SPARQL grammar which is output to sparql.js:

	var sparqlParser=require('sparql');
	var query = sparqlParser.parse(query).ref('_:query');
